# :wave: Hello There! I'm Ozzie!

As a full-stack software engineer, I bring my passion for technology to life by designing and delivering robust and scalable solutions that solve problems. 

My expertise in open-source frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, React, and .NET, combined with my strong work ethic, positive attitude, and drive to continuously learn, make me an asset to any team. 

I relish the thrill of problem-solving and am equally comfortable working independently or in a team environment, where I can bring my ambition, focus, and productivity to the table.

Feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozzierosas/">connect</a> with me, or reach out to me! <a href="mailto:ozzie.rosas@gmail.com"><b>:envelope:</b></a>
